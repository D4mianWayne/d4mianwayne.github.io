      <description>This box was without a second thought one of the favourite box of mine on HackTheBox so far, since I am more of a pwn and reverse engineering person, this machine was a challenge, an outstanding one which pushed my learning skills more further because upto the moment I really went into this, I was not a good at heap exploitation, more skeptical about the V8 exploitation skills of mine and of course I knew nothing of the kernel pwn, so this was a way to tackle every weakness of mine, hope you find the writeup useful, I&amp;rsquo;ll include the link of the attachments at the very bottom to my files, QEMU enviornment for the kernel pwn and the exploits, without further ado, let&amp;rsquo;s start.</description>
