      <description>I played this CTF event with the WeakButLeet team and in the end, we managed to get 18th rank, sadly we couldn’t do much crypto challenges but overall it was a fun CTF to get refreshed, there were other CTFs running as well but I only played this as there was a local CTF going on.</description>
