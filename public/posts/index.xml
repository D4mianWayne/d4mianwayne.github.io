      <description>I played this CTF event with the WeakButLeet team and in the end, we managed to get 18th rank, sadly we couldn’t do much crypto challenges but overall it was a fun CTF to get refreshed, there were other CTFs running as well but I only played this as there was a local CTF going on.</description>

      <description>This challenge was quite good, as someone who never really did egghunting shellcode, this was a good learning experience. So, the binary given s pretty simple, all the protections have been disabled except the PIE but, analysing the workflow, we can see that it reads shellcode and then execute that shellcode.</description>

      <description>This box was without a second thought one of the favourite box of mine on HackTheBox so far, since I am more of a pwn and reverse engineering person, this machine was a challenge, an outstanding one which pushed my learning skills more further because upto the moment I really went into this, I was not a good at heap exploitation, more skeptical about the V8 exploitation skills of mine and of course I knew nothing of the kernel pwn, so this was a way to tackle every weakness of mine, hope you find the writeup useful, I&amp;rsquo;ll include the link of the attachments at the very bottom to my files, QEMU enviornment for the kernel pwn and the exploits, without further ado, let&amp;rsquo;s start.</description>

      <description>In-depth write-up of the V8 challenge from DownUnderCTF 2020.&#xA;Foreword #Unfortunately I couldn&amp;rsquo;t solve the challenge, as it was supposed to be easy one still I couldn&amp;rsquo;t but I thought I should do a post with the writeups/exploits from other people and make it very explainative such that I can use for reference later so when I&amp;rsquo;ll get stucked I can take a look and move on with research and who knows maybe it&amp;rsquo;ll be helpful for others too.</description>
