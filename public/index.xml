      <description>I played this CTF event with the WeakButLeet team and in the end, we managed to get 18th rank, sadly we couldn’t do much crypto challenges but overall it was a fun CTF to get refreshed, there were other CTFs running as well but I only played this as there was a local CTF going on.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/hunting/</guid>
      <description>This challenge was quite good, as someone who never really did egghunting shellcode, this was a good learning experience. So, the binary given s pretty simple, all the protections have been disabled except the PIE but, analysing the workflow, we can see that it reads shellcode and then execute that shellcode.</description>

      <description>This box was without a second thought one of the favourite box of mine on HackTheBox so far, since I am more of a pwn and reverse engineering person, this machine was a challenge, an outstanding one which pushed my learning skills more further because upto the moment I really went into this, I was not a good at heap exploitation, more skeptical about the V8 exploitation skills of mine and of course I knew nothing of the kernel pwn, so this was a way to tackle every weakness of mine, hope you find the writeup useful, I&amp;rsquo;ll include the link of the attachments at the very bottom to my files, QEMU enviornment for the kernel pwn and the exploits, without further ado, let&amp;rsquo;s start.</description>

      <description>I played this CTF mainly because I was chilling out and wanted to try out some challenges from the CTF. I managed to do the every pwn challenge except space one which was heap and the exploitation mechanism of it belongs to GLIBC 2.</description>
